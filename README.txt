Pluto is a fluid-width 2 column theme based on Binarius, for Moodle 2.4. It is part of a series of ten 'Planet' themes intended to provide a choice of visually accessible and/or fun colour schemes.

Pluto is designed to provide a high contrast interface with a dark background and yellow text. It also includes a 2.4 compatible version of the MoodleBar developed by Lewis Carr, and uses the autohide functionality for course editing buttons outlined by Frankie Kam.

Yes, I know that Pluto is no longer regarded as a planet - but it was too good an opportunity to miss having a black/dark background for high contrast visual requirements.
